## Setting up Qualys Virtual Appliance

### Import Qualys OVA

- Now open VirtualBox (Yours may look different from my setup). We're going to import the OVA file we just downloaded. To do that, click "File", then "Import Appliance...".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e950db4-1cfc-4247-bfcd-8cd506d5cfeb)
- A pop up will appear where you need to select where you saved the file in your computer. Click the folder icon to browse for the file and select it to be imported. Then click "Finish".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7224e5bb-cda2-4697-92c6-f6a552eb5d9f)
- It should now import with the settings shown below. When you're done reviewing, click "Start".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1ab1d51-fc56-4b19-b92f-2cd3db98a001)
- Once booted up, you will be greeted with this screen where you will press "Enter" on your keyboard to select options throughout the process:
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58a2c714-bfee-4cb7-8a75-2a85bde72690)
- Press "Enter" on "Personalize this scanner >". It will ask you to enter the personalization code from earlier.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99bc891f-8b76-4d12-84c5-1ec4275f6cb4)
- When you enter the code, it will begin to update and connect to your Qualys profile. This process takes a few minutes.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ab19482-dae1-454c-8a75-3e73e6519749)
- Once it finishes configuring itself, you will see the private IP address that the VM will be using.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cee57fc3-e2f3-4cc8-a523-bd5e6255ec17)
- Go back to Qualys, and if you look back in your "Appliances" tab, you should see your scanner with a green connected plug icon next to it, showing that it is activated.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7381cfbf-ff87-48a2-9a56-8e93d07f8695)

### Set Qualys Scan IP Range

- The next thing we're going to do is select the IP range that Qualys will be scanning. Head to "Assets" in the left hand sidebar. Then click "Add IPs for Scanning"
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e10101dc-b541-4421-8947-e2bf0a8682fa)
- Click "New", then select "IP Tracked Addresses". You'll see a pop up on your screen.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59bc8201-43a0-4d34-a657-896cc8f26d2b)
- Click "Subscription IPs".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b16ca9b-9476-434b-b184-f91dc2f8ce14)
- ⚠️ Important: The IP range you provide Qualys is going to be based off of the IP range that your home router provides. For example, if your home router provides an IP address of `192.168.1.5`, then pick a range from "`192.168.1.2-192.168.1.18`". I'll put in `192.168.1.7`. Then click "Add".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47b972b2-fd85-498e-8772-8050e5eac0d1)
- Now you will see the range in the "Address Management" tab.

## Installing Win11 VM

### Install Windows 11

- In this step, we'll head back to VirtualBox. I have Windows 11 already installed, but to install it for yourself, within VirtualBox click "New", select the ISO we downloaded earlier, skip the unattended install, then click "Finish". Once it's finished, click "Start" to boot it up and then go through the set up process as you normally would when setting up a Windows computer.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19b33050-7b3f-476d-b507-12b03b613a15)

### Installing Outdated Software

#### VLC

- Once you're in Windows 11, we'll need to install some outdated software so that Qualys can find it during the vulnerability scan. First, open Microsoft Edge and go to `https://www.videolan.org/vlc/`. Here we can see the current version is `3.0.21`

### Assign Windows 11 an IP Address within the Qualys Scanner Range

- With the outdated software now installed, it's time to prepare to be scanned. First we'll need to bring our Windows VM to our internal network. To do that, go back to VirtualBox and click "Settings".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e75eea4d-0ae5-40c3-b631-daf55f2eebff)
- Scroll to "Network".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc94e507-8b6d-4a32-b470-3d4a4b34c7c1)
- Switch from `NAT` to `Bridged Adapter`. Then click "OK".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e22df38c-e8bb-461d-905d-9b487975dfa2)
- Now that the VM is on our internal network, we need to assign the Windows VM an IP address within the Qualys scanner range that we set earlier. To do that, search for `Control Panel` in the search bar. Then click "Open".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e2a8b10-0bed-4015-900d-eaccd8b376dd)
- Click "Network and Internet".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a66b98df-8381-478f-87dc-d2973ec84c5c)
- Click "Network and Sharing Center".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ce1523e-0489-46cf-a01f-edd387f20de0)
- Click "Ethernet".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c9b88bb-9814-452d-9482-6398e0cf777a)
- Click "Properties".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dfc7f13-c654-412c-806b-24ab4d691c54)
- Click "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)". Then click "Properties".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f61a959c-3d3f-49de-b28f-b1353314772c)
- Input the settings below and click "OK", then close out of the Control Panel windows:
	- IP address: `192.168.1.7`
	- Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`
	- Default gateway: `192.168.1.1`
	- DNS server settings: Leave blank or select what I have chosen.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe1ab3bf-fd57-40bb-8fa5-b7b1b681295b)
- Check in "Settings" to see if it has changed.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6ff518d-5d11-4736-beaa-849b723b0f94)

### Turn off Windows Firewall

- With the static IP now set, we need to allow the Qualys Scanner to not be blocked by any network obstacles. We'll need to completely turn off Windows Firewall. This is **highly** not recommended, but for the ease of the lab, we will make this exception. Begin by searching `Windows Defender Firewall`. Then open the app.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/046f12ba-8780-413d-88be-f5b82b296124)
- You'll be brought to the screen below. As you can see, I have already turned off my firewall. For you to do the same, click "Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off" on the left hand side.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a81920d3-dd6c-4dac-89f8-e4b6b668c773)
- Here is where you'll turn the firewall off for both "Public" and "Private" network settings.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f3b1f8a-1e70-4836-b706-39dfd43caf7d)

## Setting up a Scan

- Let's head back to Qualys. Click "Scans". Then click the "Option Profiles" tab.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e031a088-5e09-4996-8364-d0002e8a3774)
- Here we will make our own scan. Click "New" then click 'Option Profile...'
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26724bc3-955b-48cf-af00-55aaadac9414)
- A pop up will appear for the new option profile. Choose a name like `Basic Vuln Scan`. Then click the "Scan" tab.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0607f766-4e97-4bfc-a101-de612e624131)
- Leave everything as default including authentication, since we will be performing an unauthenticated scan for now and an authenticated one later. Click "Save".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2da69e2-72d8-491f-b4d3-26edc9fc38f3)
- Now we will see the profile we created. Head to the "Scans" tab.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7836ed31-a0c5-4a8a-a3ce-5e1d01a90796)
- Click "New", then "Scan".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0831df9a-9bee-4660-a688-94f2dd78dfaf)
- Name it `Basic Win11 Scan`. Choose the option profile we just created `Basic Vuln Scan`. Scanner appliance will `VulnLabVA` or whatever you named your scanner. For IPv4 address, we will put in the address we set for the VM `192.168.1.7`. Then click "Launch"!
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01c25aac-f901-4d66-ab03-4a81dc14a552)
- It will begin the scan after a few minutes and then take about 20-30 more minutes to complete the scan.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f306424-9207-4e57-917e-95219c3b6725)
- Scan complete! Click "View Results".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be2a2f9b-a250-41ac-939f-835af5f99f09)
- Here we have an unauthenticated vulnerability report.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ea76ba4-3334-4fac-beb7-fca00d2e209d)
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb813b3b-3434-42cf-848c-3dab77aa1104)
- Some more information is available, but you really can't see many vulnerabilities in an unauthenticated scan since it's only scanning externally. We need to grant permission to perform an authenticated scan for more precise results. You may download this current report to view it later by clicking on "File" at the top of the page and then "Download". Select your preferred format, then again click "Download".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa8a9087-7915-4273-85d0-d17da82f66c9)

## Changing Win11 Settings

- Here, we will adjust Windows 11 settings to give Qualys permission to perform an authenticated scan. In a real world scenario, Qualys would have it's own admin profile to perform these types of scans. The first thing we will do is go to `Services`.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/696f9d7e-bf7d-4fe5-996e-b775f15522e1)
- Once open, look for `Remote Registry` then right click it and click "Properties".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be14915d-ea4a-4283-8eb2-428b94695b9c)
- Change the "Startup type:" from `Disabled` to `Automatic`. Click "OK".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d3a5209-93ac-4107-ada0-b7bb34f96629)

- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/247cf649-43f9-4b03-b454-6726e44ed5b9)
- Now make sure `Server` is also set to `Automatic`, and if not, repeat the steps. Then exit out of `Services`.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ac2f4c6-cfae-49d2-9648-d11d4df2ee02)
- Search and open `Manage advanced sharing settings`.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/471d8ce1-9774-42be-8c97-a00c9ef6c816)
- Make sure both `Network discovery` and `File and printer sharing` are turned on.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49e0c1da-e736-49e3-9b33-6c6180bc7017)
- Another step we'll take is to change the User Access Control (UAC). Click "Open".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89996c35-e608-43dd-b33b-1ab9099cd91d)
- Drag the slider to the bottom to `Never notify`. Click "OK".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2acbcb9a-48ee-4e3b-89eb-7364f253c234)
- Click "Yes".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7673ec4e-fd5b-4d04-9395-0d03bfce0ac9)
- An additional step we will take is to make an edit in the Windows Registry. Type `regedit` in the search bar and open the application.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3708a29-4466-4a29-b9a6-30f13940d360)
- Type `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System` in the navigation bar. Once there, right click in a blank space, click "New", then select `DWORD (32-bit) Value`.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b00210a3-42cc-48b6-a2c6-edf5cf6a886d)
- Enter the name `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` and press "Enter". Then double-click on it to bring up the settings. Here you will change the "Value data:" to `1`. Click "OK".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c930529c-cbdf-4811-81d7-1a80b95d74e4)
- Now your machine should be ready for an authenticated scan! Head back to Qualys.

> ⚠️ **Troubleshooting issues** ⚠️
> I had issues with the Windows 11 VM I had, which was previously made for another lab and was not installed the traditional way. For some reason, I could not get an authenticated scan, even though I input the right credentials. I had to retry scanning a few more times, and after hours of troubleshooting later, I decided to create a whole new Windows VM and recreate the steps to make sure the lab was completed in a cleaner way. So the results will have different times. The new VM IP is `192.168.1.8` and worked great.
>
> I also wanted to try a safer approach to the lab by allowing only the Qualys scanner through the firewall, but I may have not configured it to let enough access through for the full scan. So, it was best to follow the directions of the video this project is based on and not deviate from the instructions of COMPLETELY turning off the firewall. Save yourself half a day by learning from my mistake. ⌛

- It's finished! Click "View Results".

- So with the non-credentialed scan, the results only showed the open ports. With the credentialed scan, we can see, the severity is much higher. Every vulnerability has a risk score, and the higher the score, the more potential it has to do harm to your machine. Almost every vulnerability contains a "**CVE**", or **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures**. It is a system that provides a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws, each identified by a unique CVE ID. It helps organizations track and manage security vulnerabilities in software and systems to improve cybersecurity.

- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcbf8885-1de5-41c1-af12-bac595fc2ea0)
- If we look at the "Detailed Results", not only did it discover vulnerabilities for VLC and Firefox, it also provides a solution, which says to it needs to upgrade the version.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6be5627-0ae6-489d-aa0e-2b3ae32c002a)
- Here we can see the outdated Firefox as well, with a fair amount of CVEs attached to this version. Upgrading this release is also a fix to this vulnerability.

## Verifying Remediations

- We're now going to relaunch the scan and compare the results now that we have remediated a few vulnerabilities.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fac1b95-13c8-48f8-a8fb-4e2cc4047416)
- Click "Launch".
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ad9db58-7476-4af4-9b50-7b7859e5b5ce)
- The scan has finished and here are the results. As you can see, there is a significant reduction in vulnerabilities.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c414a50-16c7-49e3-8ae8-120f1e7061f4)
- In the "Detailed Report" is where the difference of just removing those 2 outdated programs truly shines. `9` vulnerabilities compared to the previous `90`!
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87fde870-f9b1-46d0-b24f-c85aa234a1d2)
- That concludes our lab! If you want further practice, another side project you could do is to see how you would remediate the remaining vulnerabilities. ✅
